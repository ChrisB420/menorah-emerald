  <h1>Scroll 2: The War in Heaven</h1>
  <div class="highlight">
    “And there was war in Heaven...” — Revelation 12
  </div>

  <h2>1. The Dragon’s Flood</h2>
  <p>The enemy unleashed a flood. Gregory saw it in WWII — Nazi Germany as the beast rising. A force possessed, marching east through Europe. The woman — Israel — was the target.</p>

  <h2>2. The Earth Opened Her Mouth</h2>
  <p>The Allied forces arose. America, Britain, and the underground answered the cry. Like the earth itself opened and swallowed the waters of death. This was prophecy, not just politics.</p>

  <h2>3. Isaiah 66 Fulfilled</h2>
  <p>“Can a nation be born in a day?” It was. In 1948, Israel rose again — reborn, re-spoken, and restored in ancient tongue. Hebrew revived. God’s clock restarted. The scroll reopened.</p>

  <h2>4. The Dragon Cast Down</h2>
  <p>Revelation 12 tells it straight. Satan falls — and great wrath comes to earth. He knows his time is short. The warfare now is not just global — it is personal, generational, and dimensional.</p>

  <h2>5. Your Position in the War</h2>
  <p>You are not bystander. Your birth was timed. Your awakening matters. This scroll is your signal: rise. Overcome by the blood of the Lamb, the word of your testimony, and not loving your life unto death.</p>

  <div class="highlight">
    “We are the remnant. We are the warriors. We are the ones who carry the scrolls of memory into battle.”
