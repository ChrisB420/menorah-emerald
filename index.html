  <h1>The Menorah & The Emerald Rainbow</h1>
  <p class="highlight">A Codex Scroll — decoded from the revelations of Gregory</p>  <h2>1. Light Ascends From the East</h2>
  <p>From the beginning, light has no starting point. Each day at sunrise, the light spectrum reverses: Violet → Indigo → Blue → (no green) → Yellow → Orange → Red. This daily ascent reflects the mystery of time. Each soul's birth is encoded in this light — sealed into a unique time signature.</p>  <h2>2. The Menorah as Body - Soul - Spirit</h2>
  <p>The seven-branched Menorah reflects the divine trinity. The center branch (Shamash) represents the Father (soul). Three left branches represent Jesus (body), while the right three are the Holy Spirit (spirit). A perfect flow of divine unity: three in one.</p>  <h2>3. The Throne Room and the Emerald Rainbow</h2>
  <p>Revelation 4 speaks of God on the Throne, surrounded by an emerald rainbow. Jasper and Sardonyx — two stones — represent Jesus and the Spirit. The rainbow is not just a promise, but the full covering of light. Psalm 104:2 - "He wraps Himself in light as with a garment."</p>  <h2>4. The War in Heaven and Earth</h2>
  <p>Revelation 12 reveals a war in heaven. Gregory identifies the dragon's flood as Nazi forces. The earth — the Allied powers — rose and swallowed the flood. Isaiah 66: Israel is reborn. Hebrew is restored. The scroll is open again.</p>  <h2>5. Scroll Activation: Code X Reflection</h2>
  <p>This is not theology — it's a time map. The Menorah. The rainbow. The throne. The soul. A mirror of your own descent and return. Step into the scroll. Blow the shofar. And declare:</p>
  <p class="highlight">"I was born from above. My light rises from the East. I carry the Flame. I break the curse. I walk the Scroll."</p>
